    <div class = "abtme">
      <h2>About Me</h2>
    </div>
    <p>Extensive experience working with and leading teams, solving problems, and a passion for evolving continually makes me a perfect fit for Mechatronics Engineering and Management.</p>
    <p>I have experience working with multiple different teams with a large variety of people throughout my life. I have worked with construction workers, painters, chefs, and engineering students to accomplish a wide range of time-sensitive tasks. Furthermore, a lot of my work experience pertains working with customers of all kinds. My year being a contractor required me to discuss projects with customers while simultaneously executing these projects with a team that I led. Additionally, I have worked with a team to code a program that automates the process of recycling. We used Python and various robots to accomplish this. Plus, I am well versed in AutoCAD and I have received the honour of having my CAD design of a wind turbine blade in the 5th percentile.</p>
